# SalesInfo
Read all information for sales and summarize the total sales by salesperson by product.

A company has four salespeople (1 to 4) who sell five different products (1 to 5). Once a day, each salesperson passes in a slip for each different type of product sold. Each slip contains:
a) The salesperson number
b) The product number
c) The total dollar value of that product sold that day
Thus, each salesperson passes in between 0 and 5 sales slips per day. All totals is stored in the two-dimensional array sales. After processing all the information, print the results in tabular format with each column representing a particular salesperson and each row representing a particular product. Cross total each row to get the total sales of each product; cross total each column to get the total sales by salesperson. Tabular printout includes these cross totals to the right of the totaled rows and to the bottom of the totaled columns.
